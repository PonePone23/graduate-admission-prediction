# Graduate Admission Prediction

This project focuses on predicting graduate admission outcomes using a dataset sourced from Kaggle to develop a predictive model that estimates a student's likelihood of being admitted.

## Objectives
- Predict Admission Probability: Provide students with a prediction of their admissions before they apply.
- Model Development: Build a robust predictive model using historical data to improve admission decisions.
- Support for students and universities: Assist students in evaluating their prospects and help universities make data-driven admission choices.

## Data Description

The dataset includes various attributes such as GRE and TOEFL scores, university rankings, undergraduate GPA, research experience, and more. These features are used to train and evaluate different machine-learning models to predict the likelihood of admission.

## Methodology

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling outliers, and normalizing the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and understanding the relationships between features and the target variable.
- Model Development: Implementing machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Linear Regression, to predict admission chances.

## Libraries Used

* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* Numpy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
